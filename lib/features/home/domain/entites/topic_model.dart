## **Corporate entity**
A corporate entity is a business or government unit, that has a legal identity separate from the people who own or run it. This means that the entity can act on its own and borrow money, enter into contracts, buy and sell property, and even sue or be sued in its own name. A corporate entity is owned by shareholders, but the two are considered as separate legal entities from each other. Another example of a corporate entity is a government agency, created to have legal powers to carry out specific functions, such as collecting taxes or regulating industries.
## **Corporate objectives**
Corporate entities are established for a purpose (to provide transport services, provide drugs and chemicals, provide training and education, etc), relating to key success factors as profitability, market share, growth, cash flow, customer satisfaction, quality products, industrial relations, retention of highly skilled workforce and added value. Within the purpose are the long-term objectives of the entity. These objectives may be divided into two.
## **Primary objective**
- **Maximisation of shareholder’s wealth** - Shareholders’ wealth is measured primarily by the improvement of the market value of the company’s shares (capital gains) and therefore, directors should manage resources in a way to increase and improve the share price. 
- **Dividend** is another measure Of shareholders’ wealth. However, it should be noted that white some shareholders may be looking for a quick return on their investments in terms of dividend to meet their short-term financial objectives, some may be looking forward to build the business for the long term and to maximise their wealth through capital gains. 

This given primary objective is suitable than any other objective of a firm as it serves the interest of equity holders and all other stakeholders of a firm and it is consistent with the objective of owner’s economic welfare. Wealth maximisation takes into consideration, investment risk and time value of money as such is how present value, of any particular course of action is measured.

## Secondary objectives
A company may have other important financial and non-financial objectives, which Will limit the achievement of the primary objective. Some of the secondary objectives include:
- **Maximisation of profit** - Some correlation exists between increasing profit and increasing shareholders’ wealth. However, wealth is measured on cash basis and not on profits.
- **Satisfying other stakeholders** - Involve satisfying the needs of all other stakeholders
- **Customer satisfaction** - Refers to a firm’s duty towards customers and may include provision of products or services of quality and at lower prices, fair adverts, delivery reliability, convenience of purchase, after sales service arrangements, nutritional value information, provision of warranty and guarantees.
- **Growth** - Firms tend to go through different forms and phases, and growth may tell us how a company is improving in terms of sales. It could be expressed in terms of net profit and dividend payments, which are known to be indicators of a sound financial health of a firm.
- **Survival** - This is a measure of going concern where firms are expected to continue in operational existence into the future. Solvency and liquidity status of the organisation are the financial measures of survival in the long-term.
- **Innovation** - Innovation leads to new products and services that are higher in quality and tower in prices. In basic terms, innovation is defined as the design, development, and implementation of new or altered products, services, processes, structures, and business models to create value for the customer and financial returns for the firm. Welfare of employees - - **Competitive wages and salaries**, comfortable and safe working conditions, training and career development, offer of pension schemes, promotion and redundancy packages in the case retrenchment exercises.
- **Corporate social responsibility, brand awareness, environmental sustainability** and many others are examples of secondary objectives of corporate entities.

## ⦁	Finance directorate and financial management
The finance directorate or department is one of the six functional areas of an entity. The finance department, headed by the finance director, is in charge with the management of the firm’s financial resources to achieve organisational goals. Thus, by definition, financial management is the ongoing process of making use of the firm’s funds (financial resources) to achieve the objectives of the firm through planning, organising, directing and control. Objectives of the finance department are aligned with those of the wider corporate objectives.
### Question
Describe six key factors that are indicative of a successful corporate entity.
Explain how ordinary shareholders wealth could be measured.
- Explain why maximisation of shareholders wealth is preferred to any other financial objective such as maximisation of sales or revenue?
- Identify and explain four financial objectives of a corporate entity.
## ⦁	Roles and responsibilities of the finance director
The finance functions are:
- Formulate and recommend strategies for the achievement of the entity’s objectives.
- Recommend strategies for the acquisition and utilisation of the firm’s resources in 3Es (economy, efficiency and effectiveness).
- Advise board of directors in the design and implementation of policies in some five financial management goal areas of:
### A. Investment selection and capital resource allocation (investment decisions)
In the short-term, investment decisions do concentrate on working capital management whiles in the longer term, consideration is given to investment appraisal and selection, plus allocation of limited capital resources in times of capital rational. Also, decisions have to be made as to where funds should be invested - to acquire or merge with other firms, embark on market or product development, carry out financial reconstruction or business re-organisation, etc. Policy directions should consider:
- What method of investment appraisal technique should be used (NPV, IRR, etc.)?

- In times of capital rationing, how are competing projects to be evaluated when those projects are for a single or multiple period capital rationing, and are divisible or mutually exclusive?

### B)	Raising funds and minimising cost of capital (financing decisions) 
Finance decisions look at short-term and long-term , sources of raising funds.It is the responsibility of the finance director to be aware of the different sources of finance available to the firm, issue and interest costs associated with each source, required gearing levels, tax implications, debt covenants or restrictions and its implications on certain key financial ratios.

### C)	Distribution and Retention of earnings
Policy on retained earnings for say, re-investment in positive NPV projects.
Dividend policy: zero, constant, incremental dividend policies.
Retained earnings are significant sources of finance for investments and thus a balance needs to be struck between that and dividend pays out. Paying out too much may require an alternative source of finance to be found to finance any capital expenditure or working capital requirements and, paying out too little may fail to give shareholders their required income levels which may tend to reduce the share price.

### D)	Financial planning and control
Planning is about identifying the firm’s current resources or resource requirements and finding out strategies or directions within which firm objectives could be achieved based on the available resources. Planning again includes systems and procedures for funds mobilisation and utilisation. Budgets are good tools for financial planning and plays an important role in monitoring and controlling the use of organisational funds. Under financial control, finance directors are to ensure that effective management systems appropriate for the achievement of the organisation's objectives, including financial monitoring and internal control systems have been put in place. These financial controls may include:
-	Setting up a book-keeping system to record all transactions as firms are financially accountable to stakeholders,
-	Setting up procurement policies to govern the way in which sourcing, solicitation management (including competitive and non-competitive bidding) are carried out.
- Audit - An audit covers how much money the organisation received and spent within a financial year, and on what the money was used for. It again finds out whether the accounts (book-keeping system) have been properly and honestly kept and whether the money has been spent in accordance with management decisions and investor requirements (internal control systems or compliance audit).

### B)	Risk management
Shareholders will invest in companies with a risk profile that matches their portfolio. The finance director should then be mindful of this when altering the risk profile of the business without shareholder support. Possible solutions for dealing with risk include putting in place internal control systems and procedures, hedging the risk by taking some necessary action to ensure a certain outcome. To hedge is to enter into transactions which protect a business or assets against changes in value of some underlying items. Engaging in diversification exercises to reduce the impact of one outcome by having a portfolio of different ongoing projects or investments to do away of unsystematic risks.

###  Other functional areas of the finance director
#### 1.	Communication with stakeholders
Finance directors are to keep both external and internal stakeholders informed of all significant matters such as corporate goals and financial policies. Shareholders will need information about dividend policy, expected returns on new investment projects, gearing levels. Suppliers will need information about payment policies whiles customers will need information about pricing policies. Government is interested in the profitability of the firm and is continual existence and the payment of its taxes.
#### 1.	Ethics and social responsibility
Social responsibility covers the firm’s role towards society as a whole and the extent to which the firm should fulfill or exceed its obligations towards shareholders. Ethics may refer to the behaviour expected of individuals within the firm itself. Employment, payment of taxes, sponsoring arts and culture, pollution, moral conduct and adherence to legal issues are some of the areas where the Finance Manager should look at as part of his/her duties
#### 1.	Corporate governance
This is about how companies are directed and controlled including issues of risk management. Publication of directors’ remunerations, preparation and publication of audited financial statements annually are some other roles of the finance director.
#### 1.	Environmental sustainability
The underlying principle for firms is that environmental, social and economic systems are interdependent and that decisions of firms must address all these three concerns coherently (triple bottom fine approach). Reducing an environmental footprint involves the development and Implementation of policies for more efficient resource management, ‘green’ procurement and waste minimisation.
### Questions
1.	State and explain four finance director’s functions or decisions
2. Explain the term ' financial management’.
b)	What is the primary objective of a corporate organisation?
c)	On the 1st January 20x3, a shareholder bought shares in a company when the share price was 050,000 per share. Oil 31st December 20x3, the share price had risen to \$58,000 per share. The dividend paid at the year-end of 20x3 amounted to \$4,500 per share. You are required to:
i. Calculate the capital gain per share.
ii.	The total shareholder’s income per share.
iii.	The shareholder’s return on capital.

3.	The other functional areas of the Finance Manager include communication with stakeholders, ethics and social responsibility, corporate governance and environmental sustainability. State some of the roles to be played by the Finance Manager for the achievement of organisational goals in the above-mentioned areas.
4.	Suggest reasons why it would be important to keep the various stakeholders of an organisation informed of general corporate and financial goals and intentions.

##  Objectives of not for profit organisations
Not for profit organisations, are established to pursue non □financial aims and exist to provide services to the community(social needs) . Their major objectives are the welfare of the people in a community, welfare of employees, survival, fundraising, compliance with tax laws to achieve tax exemptions, and creation of an endowment fund to generate enough to support charitable activities. Such organisations also need funds to finance their operations. Their major constraint is the amount of funds they would be able to raise and as a result, not  for profit firms do use their limited funds judiciously to obtain value for money. Value for money simply means getting the best possible service at the least possible cost. Value for money involves providing a service which is **economical**, **efficient** and **effective** (3Es).
- **Economy** means sourcing and purchasing inputs at minimum cost consistent with the required quality of the output.
- **Efficiency** means making best use of resources, whiles 
- **Effectiveness** means being able to achieve firm objectives.

Value for money as a concept assumes that there is a yardstick against which to measure the achievement of objectives, For not-for-profit firms, it can be very difficult to determine where there is value for money. Output can seldom be measured in a way that is generally agreed to be meaningful but not specific. For example, are good exam results alone an adequate measure of quality teaching? In the National Health Service, can success be measured by fewer patient deaths per hospital admission, or shorter waiting times for operations, or average speed of patient recovery and so on. Not-for-profit organisations include such Ones as Charities, NGOs, state health service and the police service. Although sound financial management of these entities is important, they, do hot have their financial objectives same as that for corporate firms. Their focus is primarily on value for money and the provision of social need.
It should however, be noted that value for money and maximisation of wealth are both corporate objectives which can be used to measure performance of directors. As performance measure benchmarks, both ensure efficient resource mobilisation and utilisation for the acquisition of inputs to yield best results and being able to achieve both objectives have positive social impact. Meanwhile, whiles value for money is an objective for not-for-profit entities, shareholder wealth maximisation is for .profit making entities. Whereas value for money considers social welfare at large, value maximisation focuses on the interest of only ordinary shareholders. Value for money may sacrifice economic benefit for overall social good (especially for vulnerable groups) while’s value maximisation focuses on economic returns for the owners for every resource utilised.
### Question
1.	Suggest three appropriate measures each for economy efficiency and effectiveness that could be set for a newly built ultra-modern library and internet facility for a local community, based on targets.
2.	Compare and contrast value far money and corporate shareholders wealth maximisation.

  Topic(title: 'Stakeholders and their impact on corporate objectives', content: """
  ## STAKEHOLDERS AND THEIR IMPACT ON CORPORATE OBJECTIVES
### 	**The Stakeholder view**
**Stakeholders** are those who affect or are affected by the activities of an organisation. Some of these stakeholders are directors and/ or managers, employees, shareholders, customers, investors, debt holders, suppliers, government, and the community in Which the organisation finds itself. It is interesting to note that various stakeholders have conflicting interests in the organisation. The interest of directors may not be the same as interests of shareholders. Whiles directors are interested in high remuneration levels and empire building, shareholders may be interested in the continuing existence of the organisation and regular dividend payments. Also, whiles employees may be interested in j ob security and competitive salaries or wages, bond holders may be interested in the repayment of their fends and its associated interest cost.
With these varying interests, organisations have the responsibility to balance the requirements of all those stakeholder groups in relation to their relative economic power/ influence. Depending on the degree of influence with which each stakeholder possesses, the company must deliver to the various stakeholders the returns that each is seeking. It is obviously very difficult to satisfy everyone at the same time.
### 	Agency theory
Agency relationship is a description of the relationship between **management** and **shareholders** expressing fee idea that managers act as **agent** for fee shareholders (**principal**), using delegated power to run the company in fee shareholders’ best interest. Similarly, an employee is an agent of fee directors. The difficulty wife an agency relationship is that once the agent has been appointed, they act in their own selfish interests rather than pursuing fee objectives of fee principal. Conflict of interest comes to play when fee interests of fee agent are different from the interests of the principal. In the case of shareholders and directors, this means that shareholders do not earn optimum returns and thus, there is an agency loss (auditing, accounting, legal, management time, etc). It is therefore important for the principal to find ways of reducing the conflict of interest through some prudent organisational strategies
### How can goal congruence be achieved?
Goal congruence is defined as the state which leads individuals or groups to take actions which are in their self-interest and also in the best interest of the entity. In order to achieve goal congruence there should be an introduction of carefully designed mechanisms s involving putting in place policies for monitoring firm directors and other stakeholders, provision of sound incentives compensation packages and having **effective communication** with them to ensure that their interests are brought closer to those of equity holders. All three mentioned policies need to work together in order to achieve the needed goal congruence.
1.	**Monitoring director’s policies**:
Equity holders should ensure that key aims and strategies are agreed upon between all parties before their implementation, and that results and outcomes of any activity are monitored to ensure adherence with original , agreements. Where differences are detected (say, due to external environmental influences or factors, new targets will need to be set and agreed on by parties. In instances where deviations are noticed, these should be made known quickly for them to be addressed appropriately,
1.	**Compensation policies**:
Reward packages should be designed against achievement of firm objectives and value additions, An introduction of carefully designed remuneration packages for the entire workforce of the firm would go a long way to motivate them in taking decisions that are consistent with the objectives of equity holders. As part of remuneration packages for directors, share options scheme would incentivises them to work to improve capital gains or share price. In a share options scheme, selected employees are offered a number of shares with the option of the holder to exercise their rights after an agreed date to subscribe for the offered shares of the firm at a fixed price. When directors work to increase share price. the value of their offered shares also goes up for them to enjoy. Another equally good compensation package for every employee is an offer of performance-related pay (PRP). PRP incentivises managers and the workforce to maximise shareholders’ wealth. Objectives and targets are set and if they are met then bonuses are paid in accordance with an agreed formula.
3. **Communication**:
Effective communication should be a two-way affair. Directors are to be made aware of the firm’s objectives and any allowable changes to those objectives. On the other, hand, equity holders are to be made aware of the various cultural and educational background of the workers and to note the differences in that divergent workforce so they can understand why firm objectives are to be achieved
4.	**Regulatory requirements**:
Requirements such as corporate governance codes of best practice and the related stock exchange listing regulations are other good ways to be followed to encourage the achievement of stakeholder objectives

### Questions
1.	What is agency problem within the context of a limited liability company?
2.	Explain two causes of agency problem.
3.	Explain four remedies to agency problem.

  # Economic environment of businesses
## ⦁	External environment of businesses
External environment to businesses basically, considers how the macro- environmental factors influences the operations of corporate firms. However, financial management environment focuses on the influences of the economic environment alone plus the roles and influences of financial markets and institutions. Economic environment of businesses looks at how operations of firms are influenced by the economic activities of government in its line of duty to achieve its own objectives.Corporate firms need to understand how policies of government do impact on different aspects of the economy and the ramifications of those policies on the firm’s own objectives and future plans.
## ⦁	Monetary and fiscal policies of government
The major macroeconomic policy tools to consider by firms are the monetary (interest rates, money supply, exchange and inflation rates) and fiscal (fund mobilisation through taxes) policies of government which are targeted at four priority areas of government (economic growth, achievement of stable inflation, balance of payment stability, full employment of the country’s citizens). Deficits in external trade with imports exceeding exports of goods may be damaging for the purposes and prospects of economic growth. Full employment does not necessarily mean that every one that needs a job should have one all the time but then, it means that unemployment levels must be kept low. It is worth noting that economic policies of government could affect planning and decision-making of firms in various ways. For example, changes in interest rates affects borrowing costs and required rate of returns. Also, an imposition of a daily minimum wage or government restrictions on maximum hours an individual could work, or increases in corporation tax rates may all affect operations of corporate entities.
## ⦁	Financial markets and institutions
Let us now tew our attention to the influences of financial markets and institutions on firms. The financial market is categorized as capital and money markets. The capital market is where individuals and institutions trade in long-term financial assets or instruments such as bonds, and equity. The money market trades in short-term securities such as treasury bills, certificate of deposits, commercial papers, repos, interbank market, and letters of credit. Capital markets are found to be trading at the Exchanges (Ghana Stock Exchange Or London Stock Exchange). At the Exchanges the primary market is where new financial assets or instruments such as shares are initially traded. The secondary market facilitates the trade of existing financial assets or instruments to the general public. Ghana Stock Exchange is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and their main functions are to offer advice to the minister of finance about matters relating to the securities market; regulate the trading of securities; regulate, authorise and license participants in the market; maintain surveillance and to protect the market against illegal activity such as insider dealing; resolve conflict of interest among participants. Financial institutions include commercial banks, insurance firms, pension funds or schemes such as KsTU provident fund or SSNIT.
## ⦁	Performance measures and analysis of firms
Triple bottom line reporting is seen to be the ideal form of measurement, assessment and presentation of a firm’s performance towards the achievement of its objectives. Unfortunately, firms are unable to report accurately on their environmental and social footprints but only on their economic footprints. This is achieved through the use of financial ratios. The analysis is concerned with ’quantifying relationships between financial variables that are found in the statement of financial position and income of the firms and then undertaking comparison with the firm’s performance over the previous years or with other firms within the same industry to ascertain improvement or decline of the business.

  # SOURCES OF FINANCE

In this chapter we will look at the range of short and long-term sources of finance available to businesses and discuss the criteria which may be used by companies to choose from between each source of finance. Firms need fends to provide as working capital, invest in non-current assets and for all financial needs of the organisation. The main source of fends available to firms is their retained earnings, but that is unlikely to be sufficient to finance all their financial need.
## 	Criteria for choosing between sources of finance
A firm must consider the following factors in their selection between the various sources of finance.
a)	**Availability and Accessibility** - Not all sources of finance are available to all firms. Only listed companies will be able to make a public issue of bonds on a stock exchange. Smaller companies may have to obtain debt financing from their bank.
b)	**Cost: issue and interest** - issue cost is associated with the arrangements for loan application or issuing new shares. Fixed rate finance may be more expensive but the business runs the risk of adverse upward rate movements if it chooses floating rate finance.
c) **Security and covenants** - source of finance may be determined by what assets the business is willing or able to offer as collateral and covenants that the lenders wish to impose, These covenants restrict the borrower’s right to take certain actions until the debt has been repaid in fell.
d)	**Gearing levels** - Using mainly debt sources of finance is cheaper in terms of tax reliefs on interest payments but high gearing is risky and can create financial distress.
c) **Tax position** - investment in fixed assets will attract capital allowances. Depending on the current tax position of the firm and the treatment of those allowances, the company may find itself in a non-tax paying position.
## **⦁	Short-term sources of finance**
Short-term finance is usually needed by companies to run their day-to- day operations including payment of salaries, wages to employees, financing debtors and purchase of inventory. A range of short-term sources of finance are available to businesses. Some of these sources include:
### Trade credit
This means that when goods or services are delivered to a firm for use in its production they are not paid for immediately. These goods and services can then be used to generate income before the invoice has to be paid. Trade credits represent an interest free short-term loan.
### Bank Overdraft
Overdraft is where customers are made to withdraw beyond their credit balances of their current accounts and can be arranged relatively quickly, are flexible with regard to the amount borrowed at any time. The rate of interest charged on an overdraft will vary according to how creditworthy the customer is perceived by the bank. The purpose of an overdraft generally should be to cover short-term deficits. Repayment is technically on demand. Overdrafts are the most important source of short-term finance available to businesses.
### Bank or term Loans
A term loan is for a fixed amount for an agreed time and on specified terms. It is drawn in full at the beginning of the loan period and repaid at a specified time or in defined instalments, A term loan is not repayable on demand by the bank but however, if the borrower does not act in accordance with the terms, the loan can be considered in default and the bank may demand payment. Term loans are offered with a variety of repayment schedules. Often, the interest and capital repayments are predetermined.
### Operating lease
A business may lease an asset rather than buying it outright. Operating tease commit the lessee to only a short-term contract or one that can be terminated on short notice. These are certainly not expected to last for the entire useful life of the asset. Operating lease is where the lesson retains most of the risks art rewards of ownership and is responsible for servicing and maintaining the leased asset. The lessee has possession and use of the asset upon payment of specified rentals over a period. The rentals paid on an operating lease are tax deductible and attracts tax reliefs.
### ⦁	Long-term sources of finance
These sources may be categorised as equity and debt and are used usually to finance long-term investments. The term equity relates to ordinary shares only - Equity finance therefore, is the investment in a company by the ordinary shareholders, represented by the issued ordinary share capital plus reserves. There are other types of share capital relating to various types of preference shares but these are not considered part of equity, as their characteristics bear more resemblance to debt finance.
A) **Equity sources**
The main sources of equity finance are through the sale of ordinary shares to investors through a rights issue or new external share issues (placing, offers for sale, public issue, etc) and internally generated funds. Internally generated fund for corporate entities is mainly the retained earnings. Equity holders share in the rising prosperity of the business. These investors, as owners of the firm, have the right to exercise control over the company by voting at annual general meetings to determine such crucial matters as the composition of the board of directors, approve or disapprove of major strategic and policy issues such as the type of activities that the firm might engage in, or the decision to merge with another firm. There is no agreement between ordinary shareholders and the company that the investor will receive back the original capital invested. What the ordinary shareholder receives depends on how well the company is managed. Also, ordinary shareholders are the last in the queue to have their claims met when the income of the year are being distributed. Again, when a firm fold up, employees, tax authorities, trade creditors and lenders all come before ordinary shareholders. From the	company’s point of view there are two significant advantages of raising finance by selling shares.	
1.	Usually there is no obligation to pay dividend and so when losses are made the company does not have the problem of finding money for a dividend.
2.	The capital obtained from ordinary shareholders does not have to be repaid and thus do not have a redemption date.
There are, however, disadvantages of this form of finance.
3.	High cost of issuing shares usually, are higher than the cost of raising the same amount of money by obtaining loans.
4.	Also, dividends cannot be used to reduce taxable profit as dividends are paid out of after-tax earnings, whereas interest payments on loans are tax deductible.
## Rights Issue
This is a very popular method of raising new funds from existing equity holders. It is easy and relatively cheaper compared with new external issues. A rights issue is an offer to existing shareholders to subscribe for new shares, at a discount to the current market value, in proportion to their existing holdings. This enables them to retain their existing share of voting rights and those not wishing to take up their rights can sell them on the stock market, It is issued at the discretion of directors without the consent of shareholders or the stock exchange. The new share price after rights issue is known as the theoretical ex-rights price and is calculated by finding the weighted average of the old price and the rights issue price, weighted by the number of shares.

## Other external share issues
There are several methods of issuing new shares, depending on the circumstances of the company. If a company is already quoted on a stock exchange, then the following methods are available for the issue 0f new shares:
### Offer for sale
The company offers existing shares to an issuing house, which then offers the shares to the general public by advertising prospectus in which the issue price is shown. This is not an issue of new shares but a sale of existing ones to different group of investors, 
### Offer for subscription
This is a sale direct to the general public. Shares are advertised at a fixed offer price and the public are invited to buy them. In this offer, shares are sold to the issuing house by existing shareholders.
### Public issue
A sale direct to the general public but the price for the shares are not fixed and the public are invited to bid for shares.
### Placing
With a placing. a sponsor (usually a merchant bank) arranges for its private clients (institutions) to buy shares. However, at least 25% of the shares placed must be made available to the general public. The costs of this method are considerably lower than those of an offer for sale.
### New shares - unquoted companies
If a company is unquoted, then they have only two choices: to remain unquoted or become quoted. If they choose to become quoted on a stock exchange, then sources of finance listed above become available to them. When choosing between the various sources of equity finance, account must be taken of factors such as the amount of the finance and issue costs. The cheapest source of equity finance is retained earnings, then rights issues, then new share issues.
## B) Debt sources
Put at its simplest, debt has to be repaid. The usual method of debt repayment is either a combination of a regular interest, with capital (principal) spread over a period or payment of a fixed! interest over a period plus a lump sum at the end of the borrowing period. Long-term debt usually in the form of bonds, bank loans, preference shares, venture capital, and finance lease are frequently used as an alternative to equity.
### Straight bonds
They are traded on the stock market in much same way as shares, and are usually denominated in blocks of 0100 nominal value, may be secured or unsecured and may be redeemable or irredeemable. Irredeemable debt is not payable at any specified time in the future but instead, interest is payable in perpetuity. If the debt is redeemable then, the principal will be repayable at a future date.
